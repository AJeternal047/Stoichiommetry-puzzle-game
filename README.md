# Stoichiommetry-puzzle-game
A research tool puzzle game for a research project at school

I'm a senior high school student that is struggling at coding an educational webgame for a research instrument for our research. I am the only one coding and doesn't have any experience so I'm only using AI to code everything. Im doing HTML/CSS/JAVA using VisualCodeStudio. The project is supposed to be a simple puzzle game but unique, but since I dont have any experience in coding I don't know what to do anymore. With so little time, I really can't finish this project. I hope some kind hearted people can help me finish this project.
